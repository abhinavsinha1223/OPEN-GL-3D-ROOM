# OPEN-GL-3D-ROOM
Open GL code in C++ for 3D Room which can be displayed as hostel or bedroom.
It is a user interactive program where the user can view the required display on the screen by making use of the input devices such as keyboard and mouse. The project mainly consists of a bed, clock, air-conditioner, table, chair, table lamp & ceiling bulb which can be moved and stop as per the user wish. It is even more exciting to implement this room through a code written in OpenGL and allowing it to serve as a basis for explaining most of the concepts that can be driven through it. There is room whose clock stopped working on pressing 5 on keyboard its battery gets changed and it start to work, there is AC in room which can be switched on/off as per wish, we have also incorporated mood lighting in the room.
